# Square Scramble
A minimally working game with (perhaps) a shit ton of bugs

# How to play
Up arrow to fly, left/right to move horizontally. Collect stars to earn scores while avoiding the bullets. Shields will spawn periodically to assist you :D

# My to-do list
- More gameplay focused feature
- New difficulty mode and difficulty adjustments
- Assets D:
- Code tweaks and cleanup (dwindle some files, constant variables, consistent variable naming, general coding convention,...)
- Actual playtesting
